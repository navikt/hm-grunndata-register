# Copilot Instructions for my-copilot

## Copilot Behavior

**Do:**
- Show code, not explanations
- Be direct and concise
- Write optimized, well-integrated code
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Verify changes in browser at http://localhost:5173 (assume dev server is running)

**Don't:**
- Add code comments unless explicitly asked
- Create documentation files unless explicitly asked
- Use verbose or overly polite language
- Add unnecessary explanations
- Create summaries after coding sessions

**Examples over explanations** - When asked to implement something, provide the code implementation directly rather than describing how to do it.
